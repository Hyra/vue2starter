## Vue 2.0

There is little documentation available for the pre-release states of Vue and its router. Luckily the API has not changed all that much, and reading the [official documentation](https://vuejs.org/api/) is still incredibly useful.

For the router, I recommend taking a look at the examples in the [next](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/tree/next) branch of the [official vue router repo](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router).

Using the [Vue Devtools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools) is also highly recommended (includes Vuex timeline so you can travel through your app state).

## Features

- Vue 2 (pre-release)
- Vue Router (pre-release)
- Vuex (state management)
- VueResource (HTTP client)
- Webpack 2
- Babel 6
- Hot reloading
- PostCSS (with [postcss-apply](https://github.com/pascalduez/postcss-apply), [postcss-nested](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-nested), [postcss-reporter](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-reporter) and [postcss-font-magician](https://github.com/jonathantneal/postcss-font-magician))
