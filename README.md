## Vue 2.0

At the time of this writing Vue 2.0 and its router are in pre-release and as such there is limited documentation available.

For the router, I recommend taking a look at the examples in the [next](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/tree/next) branch of the [official vue router repo](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router).

Using the [Vue Devtools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools) is also highly recommended (includes Vuex timeline so you can travel through your app state).

## Features

- Vue 2 (pre-release)
- Vue Router (pre-release)
- Vuex (state management)
- VueResource (HTTP client)
- Webpack 2
- Babel 6
- Hot reloading
- PostCSS (with [postcss-apply](https://github.com/pascalduez/postcss-apply), [postcss-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import), [postcss-loader](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-loader), [postcss-nested](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-nested) and [postcss-reporter](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-reporter))
